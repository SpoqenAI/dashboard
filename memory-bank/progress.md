# Progress

This document tracks the ongoing development progress, current status, remaining tasks, and evolving project decisions for the dashboard application.

**What works:**

- The foundational Memory Bank structure has been successfully created.
- All core Memory Bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`) have been populated with detailed and comprehensive information, establishing a strong contextual understanding of the project.
- **Complete rebranding successfully implemented** with Spoqen logo and gradient color scheme across all pages.
- Logo component created and integrated throughout the application.
- Color scheme updated to match Spoqen brand identity (purple/pink/blue gradient).
- **Vapi API Recent Calls Integration has been successfully fixed and verified.** The dashboard now correctly displays recent call data from Vapi, including caller names, phone numbers, and timestamps, with proper error handling.

**What's left to build:**

- **User Authentication and Authorization:** Full implementation of secure sign-up, login, password recovery, and session management using Supabase Auth.
- **Profile Management:** Development of user profile editing functionalities, including personal details, notification settings, and security preferences.
- **Subscription Management:** Integration with Paddle for billing, including displaying subscription status, handling upgrades/downgrades, and cancellation flows.
- **Admin Panel:** Building out the administrative interface for managing users, roles, and site-wide configurations.
- **API Integrations:** Implementing specific API routes for geocoding, and further developing Sentry error reporting and general webhook handling. (Vapi Recent Calls now complete)
- **Database Schema:** Refining and applying a comprehensive database schema via Supabase Migrations (`supabase/migrations/`) that supports all outlined features.
- **UI Components:** Developing a robust set of reusable UI components based on Tailwind CSS and React.
- **Testing:** Establishing and implementing unit, integration, and end-to-end testing strategies.
- **Deployment Pipeline:** Automating deployment processes to platforms like Vercel.

**Current status:**

- Project initialization is complete.
- The comprehensive Memory Bank serves as a detailed blueprint for future development.
- Ready to commence feature development based on the documented requirements and architectural patterns.

**Known issues:**

- No critical known issues at this stage; focus is on initial development.

**Evolution of project decisions:**

- Continued commitment to a modular and scalable architecture.
- Prioritizing security and performance from the outset.
- Maintaining thorough documentation as the project progresses to ensure long-term maintainability and facilitate team collaboration.
