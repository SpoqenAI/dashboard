✅ **Real-Time Call Data** - Live integration with VAPI showing recent calls, transcripts, costs, and call details

✅ **Sentiment Analysis & Lead Quality** - AI-powered analysis of call sentiment (positive/neutral/negative) and lead quality (hot/warm/cold) with database caching for performance

✅ **Bulk Call Analysis** - On-demand processing of historical calls to populate sentiment and lead quality data

✅ **Responsive Design** - Mobile-first design that works across all device sizes

✅ **Database Schema** - Comprehensive schema supporting user profiles, settings, subscriptions, and call analysis with RLS security

✅ **Error Handling & Logging** - Comprehensive error tracking with Sentry integration and detailed logging for debugging

✅ **Placeholder Image Removal** - Eliminated all `placeholder.svg` references, ensuring no 404 errors for missing placeholder images and improving production readiness.

✅ **Softened Recent Calls Highlight** - Adjusted the highlight color for selected recent calls in the dashboard from a harsh white to a softer blue (`bg-blue-50`) for a more subtle visual indication.

## What's Left to Build

### Enhanced Analytics Features

- Advanced business intelligence and conversion tracking
- CRM system integrations for lead management
- Automated reporting and email summaries
- Custom dashboard widgets and personalization

### AI Receptionist Management

- Call forwarding setup and management interface
- Voice training and personality customization
- Integration with multiple voice providers

### Advanced Features

- Multi-language support for international clients
- API rate limiting and usage tracking
- Advanced user role management
- Webhook management interface

## Current Status

**MILESTONE ACHIEVED**: The dashboard has been successfully transformed into a comprehensive analytics platform with integrated AI receptionist configuration. **The 'Analyze Calls' functionality is now fully operational, correctly processing and populating analysis for calls that previously lacked sentiment data.** The system now offers:

- Professional-grade call analytics with trend analysis and real sentiment data
- AI-powered insights and action point generation, persisted for performance
- Real-time monitoring capabilities with user-specific data
- Advanced data filtering and visualization
- Complete call lifecycle tracking
- Intuitive AI assistant settings management

The core platform is production-ready with robust error handling, responsive design, and scalable architecture.

## Known Issues

### Technical Debt

- Memory bank system needs regular maintenance for accuracy
- Some legacy components could be modernized
- API rate limiting not yet implemented for VAPI endpoints

### Enhancement Opportunities

- Action points AI can be enhanced with proper LLM integration (currently uses pattern matching)
- Additional chart types and data visualizations could be added
- Mobile responsiveness could be further optimized

### Recently Fixed

- **✅ COMPLETED: Critical Call Success Evaluation Logic Fix (Jan 2025)**

  - **Problem:** ALL calls (64/64) were being marked as successful due to incorrect priority order - `status='ended'` was checked first and treated as success indicator
  - **Root Cause:** `'ended'` in VAPI means "call finished" NOT "call successful", but our logic prioritized status over AI analysis and endedReason
  - **Discovery:** Detailed logging revealed VAPI provides `call.analysis.successEvaluation` (AI-powered) but was being ignored
  - **Solution:** Completely reordered evaluation priority: 1) VAPI AI analysis, 2) endedReason, 3) explicit status (excluding 'ended'), 4) duration fallback
  - **Impact:** Fixed fundamental accuracy issue - now properly identifies failed calls like "silence-timed-out" scenarios
  - **Expected Result:** Answer rate should change from unrealistic 100% (64/64) to realistic ~98% (63/64)
  - **Files Modified:** `app/api/vapi/analytics/route.ts` (both calculateMetrics and calculateTrends functions)

- **✅ COMPLETED: VAPI Success Evaluation Integration (Jan 2025)**

  - **Problem:** Used hardcoded arrays of `endedReason` strings to determine call success, which was maintenance-heavy and inaccurate
  - **Solution:** Replaced with VAPI's built-in `call.analysis.successEvaluation` which uses AI to determine call success based on assistant objectives
  - **Benefits:** More accurate success determination, handles multiple rubric types (boolean, numeric, descriptive), eliminates hardcoded filtering
  - **Files Modified:** `app/api/vapi/analytics/route.ts`, `app/dashboard/page.tsx`
  - **Impact:** More intelligent and maintainable call success classification

- **✅ COMPLETED: Data Consistency Fix - Analytics Count Alignment (Jan 2025)**

  - **Problem:** Discrepancy between call counts (64) and sentiment analysis counts (68) due to orphaned database records
  - **Solution:** Modified analytics API to only count analysis data for calls that exist in both current VAPI dataset AND database
  - **Impact:** Perfect data alignment - sentiment totals now match call totals for accurate reporting

- **✅ COMPLETED: Dashboard Metrics Calculation Issues (Jan 2025)**
  - **Problem:** "Avg Duration" and "Answered" metrics were inaccurate - first showing 0, then showing inflated 100% answer rates
  - **Root Causes:**
    1. Analytics API was processing raw VAPI calls without mapping them to include calculated duration field from timestamps
    2. Filtering logic wasn't excluding failed calls (timeouts, errors) leading to inflated success rates
  - **Solution:**
    - Fixed analytics API to apply `mapVapiCallToFrontend` transformation BEFORE calculating metrics
    - Enhanced call filtering to exclude failed call types: `
