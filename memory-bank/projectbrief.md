- **Admin Panel:** Functionality for administrators to manage user accounts, site-wide settings, and monitor system health.
- **Scalability and Performance:** The application should be designed to handle a growing user base and maintain high performance under load.
- **Observability:** Integrated logging and error tracking (e.g., Sentry) for monitoring and debugging.

**Key Goals:**

- Provide a clean, modern, and highly responsive user interface.
- Ensure robust security for all user data and transactions.
- Minimize friction in user workflows for common tasks.
- Facilitate easy expansion with new features and integrations.
- Maintain a well-documented codebase for future development and maintenance.
