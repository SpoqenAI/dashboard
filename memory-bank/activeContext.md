# Active Context

This document tracks the current work focus, recent changes, next steps, and important decisions.

## Current Focus

Successfully integrated comprehensive real-time and historical call sentiment analysis into the dashboard, restored full AI receptionist settings management, and implemented user-specific data filtering to ensure privacy and relevance. **The 'Analyze Calls' button now correctly identifies and processes calls that lack sentiment analysis, ensuring the dashboard provides a complete and accurate overview of all user-specific calls.**

## Recent Changes

- **COMPLETED: Comprehensive Dashboard Redesign & AI Settings Restoration**
  - Transformed the dashboard into a tabbed interface with dedicated sections for Analytics and AI Settings.
  - **Analytics Tab Enhancements:**
    - Replaced mock sentiment and lead quality data with real analysis from the new `call_analysis` database table.
    - Implemented user-specific filtering in `/api/vapi/analytics` to display only calls associated with the logged-in user's VAPI assistant.
    - Added a "Bulk Analyze Calls" button to trigger on-demand processing of historical calls via the new `/api/vapi/bulk-analyze` endpoint.
  - **AI Settings Tab Restoration:**
    - Fully restored AI receptionist editing capabilities (`aiAssistantName`, `yourName`, `businessName`, `greetingScript`).
    - Re-integrated client-side validation, profanity filtering, and character limits for AI settings.
    - Added confirmation dialogs for saving AI settings.
    - Ensured seamless synchronization of AI settings with VAPI via `syncVapiAssistant` action.
  - **Database Changes:**
    - Created `public.call_analysis` table to cache AI-generated insights (sentiment, lead quality, key points, etc.) for performance and persistence.
    - Added `vapi_assistant_id` to `public.user_settings` to link users directly to their deployed VAPI assistants.
  - Updated `/api/vapi/action-points` to persist generated analysis results to `call_analysis` table.
  - Implemented `/api/vapi/bulk-analyze` to allow batch processing of unanalyzed calls for sentiment and lead quality.

- **FIXED: 'Analyze Calls' Button (Bulk Analysis Logic)**
  - **Problem:** The bulk analysis API was not correctly identifying or processing calls that needed analysis, leading to no new data being populated despite clicking the button. This was due to overly strict content filtering (`durationSeconds` being `undefined`) and incorrect logic for skipping already analyzed calls.
  - **Solution:**
    - Modified the call filtering logic in `app/api/vapi/bulk-analyze/route.ts` to match the broader criteria used by the analytics API, ensuring *all* relevant user calls are considered for analysis, regardless of `durationSeconds`.
    - Implemented a precise mechanism to **only process calls that genuinely lack existing analysis** in the `call_analysis` table. Calls already analyzed are now correctly skipped.
    - Simplified the API and dashboard by removing the redundant `skipExisting` and `forceAnalyze` parameters, as the core functionality now inherently focuses on processing only unanalyzed calls.
    - Enhanced logging in the `bulk-analyze` API to provide clearer insights into the number of total calls, calls needing analysis, and calls actually processed, aiding in debugging and verification.

- Updated memory bank files with comprehensive documentation, including `projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, and `systemPatterns.md`.

## Next Steps

- Thoroughly test all new dashboard functionalities: data filtering, sentiment display, AI settings save/cancel, and bulk analysis. **Confirm that the 'Analyze Calls' button now correctly populates analysis for previously unanalyzed calls.**
- Monitor dashboard performance and user feedback.
- Consider adding additional AI insights and business intelligence features.
- Potential integrations with CRM systems or lead management tools.
- Expand analytics to include conversion tracking and ROI metrics.

## Decisions and Considerations

- Chose to completely redesign rather than incrementally update for better user experience.
- Implemented comprehensive error handling and loading states for production readiness.
- Used pattern-based AI analysis for action points (can be enhanced with LLM integration).
- Prioritized real-time data updates to ensure agents have current information.
- Focused on real estate specific insights and lead qualification metrics.
- **Prioritized user-specific data filtering for security and privacy, ensuring users only interact with their own assistant's data.**
- **Adopted a tabbed interface for the dashboard to provide a more organized and intuitive user experience for both analytics and settings management.**
- **Refined bulk analysis logic to be precise in only analyzing calls that lack existing data, optimizing API usage and ensuring data integrity.**

## Learnings and Insights

- The project successfully transformed from a basic settings interface to a professional analytics dashboard with integrated AI configuration.
- VAPI integration provides rich call data that enables meaningful business insights.
- Real-time analytics are crucial for AI receptionist monitoring and optimization.
- The modular architecture allows for easy future enhancements and feature additions.
- TypeScript typing ensures robust data handling across the analytics pipeline.
- The dashboard now provides actionable insights that help real estate agents improve their lead conversion.
- **Balancing rapid feature development with thorough data privacy and security measures (like RLS and user-specific filtering) is paramount.**
- **Precise filtering and conditional processing are crucial for efficient data management in bulk operations, preventing redundant work and optimizing resource usage.**
