# Active Context

**Current Work Focus:** âœ… **COMPLETED:** Successfully migrated AI-generated Action Points from OpenAI to Vapi's built-in analysis feature.

**âœ… RESOLVED: Call Purpose and Action Points Analysis**

**Issue RESOLVED:** The Call Purpose field was displaying "Analysis not available" and only showing one Key Discussion Point instead of multiple structured action points.

**Root Cause Identified:** The VAPI assistant was not configured with the analysis plan for structured data extraction.

**Solution IMPLEMENTED:** 
1. âœ… **Assistant ID Found:** Spoqen Demo Agent (93d114b3-6eb5-4cb8-a355-5f5785cd6a9d)
2. âœ… **Assistant Configured:** Applied the action points analysis plan via direct VAPI API call
3. âœ… **Configuration Verified:** Assistant now properly configured for structured data extraction

**FIXED:** New calls will now automatically include:
- Call Purpose analysis (instead of "Analysis not available")
- Multiple Key Discussion Points (not just one fallback)
- Sentiment detection (positive/neutral/negative) 
- Follow-up action items
- Urgent concerns identification

**Files Created for Resolution:**
- `configure-assistant.js` - Helper script to configure assistant with action points analysis
- `check-assistant-config.js` - Script to check current assistant configuration status

    - Uses Anthropic Claude Sonnet (with OpenAI GPT-4o fallback) - included with Vapi subscription
    - Eliminates additional API costs while maintaining same functionality
    - Analysis happens automatically after each call completes
  - **âœ… COMPLETED: Vapi Analysis Configuration:**
    - Created `lib/vapi/analysis-config.ts` with custom analysis plan for action points
    - Configured structured data schema to extract callPurpose, sentiment, keyPoints, followUpItems, urgentConcerns
    - Added utility functions in `lib/vapi/configure-action-points.ts` to configure assistants
    - Created API endpoint `/api/vapi/configure-action-points` for assistant configuration
  - **âœ… UPDATED: API Endpoints:**
    - Modified `/api/vapi/calls/[id]/action-points` to extract data from Vapi's analysis.structuredData
    - Fixed Next.js 15 async params issue by properly awaiting params
    - Improved error handling and logging for production debugging
  - Enhanced dashboard with Action Points display showing:
    - Call purpose analysis
    - Sentiment detection (positive/neutral/negative)
    - Key discussion points
    - Follow-up action items
    - Urgent concerns identification
  - Added proper loading states and error handling for AI processing
  - All action points are now extracted from Vapi's automatic analysis

- **ADOPTED:** OpenAI GPT-4o-mini for cost-effective AI action point generation
- **ADOPTED:** Separation of client/server type definitions to avoid import conflicts
- **ðŸ”§ IDENTIFIED:** Assistant configuration required for action points analysis to work properly
- Using proven Call History UI pattern for consistency and better user experience
- Ensuring the memory bank provides sufficient context for future feature development and troubleshooting
- Anticipating common architectural patterns for a dashboard application (e.g., client-server communication, database interactions)
- Proper API error handling and logging for production debugging
- **CONFIRMED:** All existing functionality (auth, billing, settings) remains intact

**Important Patterns and Preferences:**

- Emphasis on clear, concise, and actionable documentation
- Adherence to best practices for maintainable and scalable code
- Prioritizing security and performance in all design and implementation decisions
- Following external API documentation precisely to avoid integration issues
- **CONFIRMED:** Preferring reliable client-side calculations over unreliable external analytics APIs
- **CONFIRMED:** Using proven UI patterns (Call History design) for consistent user experience
- **CONFIRMED:** Using modern data fetching libraries (react-query) for better UX and caching
- **NEW:** Separating client-side and server-side type definitions to avoid bundling issues
- **NEW:** Using isolated AI service architecture for maintainable OpenAI integration
- **NEW:** Requiring assistant configuration before action points analysis can function

**Learnings and Project Insights:**

- A well-defined memory bank significantly reduces onboarding time and improves development efficiency
- Early documentation of architectural decisions helps prevent technical debt
- Always verify API endpoints against official documentation when debugging 404 errors
- Proper data transformation between external APIs and frontend is crucial for maintaining clean interfaces
- **CONFIRMED:** Sometimes external analytics APIs are unreliable and client-side calculation is more dependable
- **CONFIRMED:** When APIs consistently return errors (400/500), falling back to direct data calculation is often better
- **CONFIRMED:** Redesigning problematic features with proven patterns can dramatically improve reliability
- **CONFIRMED:** User experience is more important than using "advanced" API features that don't work properly
- **CONFIRMED:** Proper dependency management and provider setup is crucial for React Query integration
- **CONFIRMED:** Always test builds after major changes to catch dependency issues early
- **NEW:** Client-side imports of server-only libraries (like OpenAI) cause webpack bundling errors
- **NEW:** Creating separate type-only files prevents accidental bundling of server dependencies
- **NEW:** OpenAI integration works best when isolated to server-side API routes and services
- **NEW:** AI features should have proper fallback states and error handling for production reliability
- **NEW:** VAPI assistants must be configured with analysis plans before structured data extraction works
- **NEW:** The "Analysis not available" fallback indicates missing assistant configuration, not code errors
