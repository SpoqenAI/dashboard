## Current Focus

**âœ… COMPLETED: Sentiment & Lead Quality Display Fix (January 2025)** - Fixed the dashboard columns to properly show sentiment and lead quality data from VAPI's native analysis.

**Root Issue**: The `mapVapiCallToFrontend` function was extracting `summary` from VAPI analysis data but completely ignoring `sentiment` and `leadQuality` from `call.analysis.structuredData`. Dashboard columns were showing empty dashes (-) instead of the actual analysis data.

**ðŸš€ CRITICAL FIX COMPLETED: Leveraged VAPI Native Analysis (January 2025)** - Completely replaced flawed hardcoded real estate analysis logic with VAPI's native AI-powered analysis capabilities. The system now properly uses `call.analysis.structuredData`, `call.analysis.summary`, and `call.analysis.successEvaluation` instead of hardcoded pattern matching.

**Original Root Issue**: The call analysis system was using hardcoded real estate-specific logic (looking for "buy", "sell", "appointment", "showing") and defaulting to "Standard real estate inquiry" despite the business model pivot to tech/startup audience.

## Recent Changes âœ…

### **Sentiment & Lead Quality Display Fix**
- **Updated `mapVapiCallToFrontend` function** to extract:
  - `sentiment` from `vapiCall.analysis?.structuredData?.sentiment`
  - `leadQuality` from `vapiCall.analysis?.structuredData?.leadQuality`
- **Enhanced call data enrichment** to pull from database `call_analysis` table when available
- **Prioritized database analysis** over VAPI analysis for consistency
- **Added proper TypeScript typing** for sentiment and leadQuality fields

### **VAPI Native Analysis Integration**
- **Replaced hardcoded analysis** in `/app/api/vapi/action-points/route.ts` 
- **Updated bulk analysis** in `/app/api/vapi/bulk-analyze/route.ts`
- **Now properly leverages VAPI's three analysis features:**
  1. `call.analysis.summary` - AI-generated call summary
  2. `call.analysis.successEvaluation` - AI success assessment
  3. `call.analysis.structuredData` - Structured data extraction (sentiment, leadQuality, callPurpose, etc.)

## Expected Results

Users should now see:
- **Sentiment badges** (Positive/Neutral/Negative) in the Sentiment column
- **Lead Quality badges** (Hot/Warm/Cold) in the Lead Quality column  
- **Proper filtering** by sentiment and lead quality
- **Accurate analytics charts** showing real sentiment/lead distributions
- **Consistent data** between dashboard and action points analysis

## Data Flow Overview

```
VAPI Call â†’ Analysis (AI) â†’ Structured Data â†’ Database Storage â†’ Dashboard Display
                â†“                 â†“                    â†“               â†“
         AI Analysis    sentiment/leadQuality    call_analysis   Dashboard Columns
```

## Next Steps

1. **Test the dashboard** to verify sentiment and lead quality columns are populated
2. **Run bulk analysis** to backfill any missing analysis data
3. **Monitor logs** to ensure VAPI analysis data is being extracted correctly
4. **Validate filtering** works properly with new data

## Technical Notes

- The system now properly extracts from `call.analysis.structuredData` per VAPI documentation
- Database analysis takes precedence over live VAPI analysis for consistency
- All sentiment/lead quality data flows through the same structured pipeline
- Fixed variable redeclaration errors in analytics route

## Business Context

This fix aligns the dashboard display with the new business model targeting tech/startup founders instead of real estate professionals. The analysis now shows generic business sentiment and lead quality rather than real estate-specific categories.
