# Active Context

**Current Work Focus:** Successfully fixed the Vapi API integration for Recent Calls functionality.

**Recent Changes:**

- Complete rebranding implemented with Spoqen logo and gradient color scheme
- Updated all pages (home, login, signup, dashboard, onboarding, forgot-password, reset-password) to use new Logo component
- Created reusable Logo component that uses the provided "spoqen-transparent-logo.png"
- Updated color scheme in `globals.css` and `tailwind.config.ts` to match Spoqen brand colors (purple/pink/blue gradient)
- Added custom Spoqen gradient utilities to Tailwind config
- All memory bank files populated with detailed project context
- **Fixed Vapi API Recent Calls Integration:**
  - Corrected API endpoint from `/v1/calls` to `/call` to match Vapi API documentation
  - Added proper data mapping to transform Vapi response format to frontend-expected structure
  - Updated frontend hook to handle array response directly instead of object with calls property
  - Improved error handling and logging for better debugging
  - Fixed individual call details endpoint to use correct `/call/{id}` path

**Next Steps:**

1. Test the Vapi API integration to ensure it's working correctly
2. Continue feature development based on documented requirements
3. Implement user authentication flows
4. Develop subscription management features
5. Build out admin panel functionality

**Active Decisions and Considerations:**

- Ensuring the memory bank provides sufficient context for future feature development and troubleshooting
- Anticipating common architectural patterns for a dashboard application (e.g., client-server communication, database interactions)
- Identifying core technologies based on the existing file structure and common modern web development practices
- Proper API error handling and logging for production debugging

**Important Patterns and Preferences:**

- Emphasis on clear, concise, and actionable documentation
- Adherence to best practices for maintainable and scalable code
- Prioritizing security and performance in all design and implementation decisions
- Following external API documentation precisely to avoid integration issues

**Learnings and Project Insights:**

- A well-defined memory bank significantly reduces onboarding time and improves development efficiency
- Early documentation of architectural decisions helps prevent technical debt
- Always verify API endpoints against official documentation when debugging 404 errors
- Proper data transformation between external APIs and frontend is crucial for maintaining clean interfaces
