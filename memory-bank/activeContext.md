## Current Focus

Recently completed a comprehensive redesign of the dashboard to transform it from a settings-focused interface into a full-featured analytics and monitoring system for the VAPI AI receptionist.

## Recent Changes

- **COMPLETED: Comprehensive Dashboard Redesign**
  - Replaced the basic settings dashboard with a comprehensive analytics-focused dashboard
  - Created new type definitions in `lib/types.ts` for VAPI calls, action points, and analytics
  - Built custom hooks: `useActionPoints()` and `useDashboardAnalytics()` for data management
  - Implemented real-time analytics API at `/api/vapi/analytics` with trend calculation
  - Added AI-powered action points generation at `/api/vapi/action-points`
  - Created `DashboardAnalytics` component with rich data visualizations
  - Integrated comprehensive call management with detailed call dialogs
  - Added intelligent filtering, search, and sorting capabilities
  - Implemented real-time updates with configurable refresh intervals

- **Key Features Implemented:**
  - Real-time call analytics with metrics (total calls, answered, missed, avg duration, costs)
  - Sentiment analysis and lead quality distribution tracking
  - Call volume trends and peak hour analysis
  - Advanced search and filtering by status, phone number, and content
  - Detailed call inspection with AI-generated insights
  - Responsive design with loading states and error handling
