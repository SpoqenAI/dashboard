# Active Context

**Current Work Focus:** Successfully implemented dashboard metrics using Vapi Analytics API.

**Recent Changes:**

- Complete rebranding implemented with Spoqen logo and gradient color scheme
- Updated all pages (home, login, signup, dashboard, onboarding, forgot-password, reset-password) to use new Logo component
- Created reusable Logo component that uses the provided "spoqen-transparent-logo.png"
- Updated color scheme in `globals.css` and `tailwind.config.ts` to match Spoqen brand colors (purple/pink/blue gradient)
- Added custom Spoqen gradient utilities to Tailwind config
- All memory bank files populated with detailed project context
- **Fixed Vapi API Recent Calls Integration:**
  - Corrected API endpoint from `/v1/calls` to `/call` to match Vapi API documentation
  - Added proper data mapping to transform Vapi response format to frontend-expected structure
  - Updated frontend hook to handle array response directly instead of object with calls property
  - Improved error handling and logging for better debugging
  - Fixed individual call details endpoint to use correct `/call/{id}` path
- **Fixed Dashboard Metrics Implementation:**
  - Replaced manual call aggregation with Vapi Analytics API (`POST /analytics`)
  - Implemented proper analytics queries for total calls, answered calls, missed calls, and average duration
  - Fixed 500 errors in dashboard metrics API by using the correct Vapi endpoint
  - Added proper request structure with queries array and filters
  - Improved efficiency by using server-side aggregation instead of fetching individual records

**Next Steps:**

1. Test the dashboard metrics to ensure they display correctly
2. Implement conversion rate tracking when metadata support is added
3. Continue feature development based on documented requirements
4. Implement user authentication flows
5. Develop subscription management features
6. Build out admin panel functionality

**Active Decisions and Considerations:**

- Using Vapi Analytics API for dashboard metrics is more efficient than manual aggregation
- Ensuring the memory bank provides sufficient context for future feature development and troubleshooting
- Anticipating common architectural patterns for a dashboard application (e.g., client-server communication, database interactions)
- Identifying core technologies based on the existing file structure and common modern web development practices
- Proper API error handling and logging for production debugging

**Important Patterns and Preferences:**

- Emphasis on clear, concise, and actionable documentation
- Adherence to best practices for maintainable and scalable code
- Prioritizing security and performance in all design and implementation decisions
- Following external API documentation precisely to avoid integration issues
- Using dedicated API endpoints when available rather than manual data processing

**Learnings and Project Insights:**

- A well-defined memory bank significantly reduces onboarding time and improves development efficiency
- Early documentation of architectural decisions helps prevent technical debt
- Always verify API endpoints against official documentation when debugging 404 errors
- Proper data transformation between external APIs and frontend is crucial for maintaining clean interfaces
- Vapi provides specialized Analytics API endpoints that are more efficient for dashboard metrics than fetching individual records
- Using POST requests with proper query structures for analytics provides better performance and reduces API calls
