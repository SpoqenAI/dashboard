# Active Context

**Current Work Focus:** Successfully completed comprehensive rebranding of the application with Spoqen logo and color scheme.

**Recent Changes:**
-   Complete rebranding implemented with Spoqen logo and gradient color scheme
-   Updated all pages (home, login, signup, dashboard, onboarding, forgot-password, reset-password) to use new Logo component
-   Created reusable Logo component that uses the provided "spoqen transparent logo.png"
-   Updated color scheme in `globals.css` and `tailwind.config.ts` to match Spoqen brand colors (purple/pink/blue gradient)
-   Added custom Spoqen gradient utilities to Tailwind config
-   All memory bank files populated with detailed project context

**Next Steps:**
1.  Begin feature development based on documented requirements
2.  Implement user authentication flows
3.  Develop subscription management features
4.  Build out admin panel functionality

**Active Decisions and Considerations:**
-   Ensuring the memory bank provides sufficient context for future feature development and troubleshooting.
-   Anticipating common architectural patterns for a dashboard application (e.g., client-server communication, database interactions).
-   Identifying core technologies based on the existing file structure and common modern web development practices.

**Important Patterns and Preferences:**
-   Emphasis on clear, concise, and actionable documentation.
-   Adherence to best practices for maintainable and scalable code.
-   Prioritizing security and performance in all design and implementation decisions.

**Learnings and Project Insights:**
-   A well-defined memory bank significantly reduces onboarding time and improves development efficiency.
-   Early documentation of architectural decisions helps prevent technical debt.
