# Active Context

**Current Work Focus:** ✅ **COMPLETED:** Successfully implemented AI-generated Action Points feature and resolved OpenAI import issues.

**Recent Changes:**

- Complete rebranding implemented with Spoqen logo and gradient color scheme
- Updated all pages (home, login, signup, dashboard, onboarding, forgot-password, reset-password) to use new Logo component
- Created reusable Logo component that uses the provided "spoqen-transparent-logo.png"
- Updated color scheme in `globals.css` and `tailwind.config.ts` to match Spoqen brand colors (purple/pink/blue gradient)
- Added custom Spoqen gradient utilities to Tailwind config
- All memory bank files populated with detailed project context
- **Fixed Vapi API Recent Calls Integration:**
  - Corrected API endpoint from `/v1/calls` to `/call` to match Vapi API documentation
  - Added proper data mapping to transform Vapi response format to frontend-expected structure
  - Updated frontend hook to handle array response directly instead of object with calls property
  - Improved error handling and logging for better debugging
  - Fixed individual call details endpoint to use correct `/call/{id}` path
- **✅ COMPLETED: Complete Dashboard Redesign:**
  - Replaced complex, problematic analytics API integration with clean Call History-style interface
  - Removed dependency on broken Vapi Analytics API that was causing continuous 400/500 errors
  - Implemented client-side metrics calculation from actual call data
  - Added clean, modern UI with search, filtering, and sorting capabilities
  - Metrics now calculated directly from `/api/vapi/recent-calls` endpoint data
  - Added detailed call view dialog with comprehensive call information
  - Improved user experience with proper loading states and error handling
  - Dashboard now shows: Total Calls, Answered Calls, Missed Calls, Average Duration
  - All metrics are real-time and based on actual call data, not problematic analytics queries
- **✅ COMPLETED: Technical Infrastructure Fixes:**
  - Added @tanstack/react-query dependency for data fetching
  - Created QueryClientProvider setup in lib/providers.tsx
  - Updated app layout to include query client provider
  - Fixed API data mapping to match dashboard expectations
  - Updated recent-calls API to return proper field names (endedReason, durationSeconds, etc.)
  - Cleaned up unused files and directories
  - Verified build process works correctly
  - Ensured no breaking changes to other app functionality (login, billing, settings, etc.)
- **✅ COMPLETED: AI-Generated Action Points Feature:**
  - Implemented AI service using OpenAI GPT-4o-mini for action point extraction
  - Created API endpoint `/api/vapi/calls/[id]/action-points` for server-side AI processing
  - Added client-side hook `useActionPoints` for UI integration
  - **✅ FIXED: OpenAI Import Issue:**
    - Resolved "Module not found: Can't resolve 'openai'" error
    - Created separate `lib/types.ts` file for shared interfaces (ActionPoints, VapiCall)
    - Moved client-side imports to use types-only imports from `lib/types.ts`
    - Kept server-side OpenAI usage isolated to `lib/ai-service.ts` and API routes
    - Verified both development and production builds work correctly
  - Enhanced dashboard with Action Points display showing:
    - Call purpose analysis
    - Sentiment detection (positive/neutral/negative)
    - Key discussion points
    - Follow-up action items
    - Urgent concerns identification
  - Added proper loading states and error handling for AI processing
  - All action points are generated dynamically when viewing call details

**Next Steps:**

1. ✅ **COMPLETED:** Fix dashboard metrics display issues
2. ✅ **COMPLETED:** Resolve build and dependency issues
3. ✅ **COMPLETED:** Ensure no breaking changes to other app functionality
4. ✅ **COMPLETED:** Implement AI-generated action points feature
5. ✅ **COMPLETED:** Fix OpenAI import issues
6. Monitor dashboard performance and user feedback
7. Continue feature development based on documented requirements
8. Implement user authentication flows (already working)
9. Develop subscription management features (already working)
10. Build out admin panel functionality

**Active Decisions and Considerations:**

- **ABANDONED:** Vapi Analytics API integration due to persistent API issues and unreliable responses
- **ADOPTED:** Client-side metrics calculation from call data for reliability and accuracy
- **ADOPTED:** @tanstack/react-query for robust data fetching and caching
- **ADOPTED:** OpenAI GPT-4o-mini for cost-effective AI action point generation
- **ADOPTED:** Separation of client/server type definitions to avoid import conflicts
- Using proven Call History UI pattern for consistency and better user experience
- Ensuring the memory bank provides sufficient context for future feature development and troubleshooting
- Anticipating common architectural patterns for a dashboard application (e.g., client-server communication, database interactions)
- Proper API error handling and logging for production debugging
- **CONFIRMED:** All existing functionality (auth, billing, settings) remains intact

**Important Patterns and Preferences:**

- Emphasis on clear, concise, and actionable documentation
- Adherence to best practices for maintainable and scalable code
- Prioritizing security and performance in all design and implementation decisions
- Following external API documentation precisely to avoid integration issues
- **CONFIRMED:** Preferring reliable client-side calculations over unreliable external analytics APIs
- **CONFIRMED:** Using proven UI patterns (Call History design) for consistent user experience
- **CONFIRMED:** Using modern data fetching libraries (react-query) for better UX and caching
- **NEW:** Separating client-side and server-side type definitions to avoid bundling issues
- **NEW:** Using isolated AI service architecture for maintainable OpenAI integration

**Learnings and Project Insights:**

- A well-defined memory bank significantly reduces onboarding time and improves development efficiency
- Early documentation of architectural decisions helps prevent technical debt
- Always verify API endpoints against official documentation when debugging 404 errors
- Proper data transformation between external APIs and frontend is crucial for maintaining clean interfaces
- **CONFIRMED:** Sometimes external analytics APIs are unreliable and client-side calculation is more dependable
- **CONFIRMED:** When APIs consistently return errors (400/500), falling back to direct data calculation is often better
- **CONFIRMED:** Redesigning problematic features with proven patterns can dramatically improve reliability
- **CONFIRMED:** User experience is more important than using "advanced" API features that don't work properly
- **CONFIRMED:** Proper dependency management and provider setup is crucial for React Query integration
- **CONFIRMED:** Always test builds after major changes to catch dependency issues early
- **NEW:** Client-side imports of server-only libraries (like OpenAI) cause webpack bundling errors
- **NEW:** Creating separate type-only files prevents accidental bundling of server dependencies
- **NEW:** OpenAI integration works best when isolated to server-side API routes and services
- **NEW:** AI features should have proper fallback states and error handling for production reliability
